# PGxO

A lightweight and simple ontology to reconcile and trace knowledge in pharmacogenomics (PGx).

PGxO is also available on the [NCBO BioPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PGXO).

## Documentation

Documentation is available in the ``doc/`` folder:

* [pgxo.html](doc/pgxo.html): HTML documentation of PGxO
* [pgxo-overview.pdf](doc/pgxo-overview.pdf): Figure presenting PGxO **main** concepts and relations.
* [MIRO.md](doc/MIRO.md): Minimum Information for the Reporting of an Ontology (MIRO) associated with PGxO.
* [pgxo_with_instances.owl](doc/pgxo_with_instances.owl): An instantiated version of PGxO.
* [global-fig.pdf](doc/global-fig.pdf): Global figure presenting the instantiation of PGxO.

## Mappings

Mappings are available in the ``mappings/`` folder:

* [mapp1.owl](mappings/mapp1.owl): Mappings from PGxO to four ontologies related to PGx (SO-PHARM, PO, PHARE and Genomic CDS).
* [mapp2.owl](mappings/mapp2.owl): Mappings from PGxO to three large spectrum ontologies (MeSH, NCIt and SNOMED CT).
